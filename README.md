# Sonar Signal Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Repository Information
**Repository Name:** `sonar-classification-knn`

**Description:** A machine learning project that classifies sonar signals to distinguish between rocks (R) and metal objects (M) using K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm with hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV.

## Project Overview

This project implements a binary classification system to analyze sonar signals and differentiate between rocks and metal objects. The dataset contains sonar readings with various frequency measurements, and the goal is to build an accurate classifier using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

## Dataset

The project uses the Sonar dataset (`sonar.all-data.csv`) which contains:
- **Features:** 60 numerical attributes representing sonar signal measurements at different frequencies
- **Target:** Binary classification labels ('R' for Rock, 'M' for Metal)
- **Size:** 208 samples total

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Standard scaling of features for optimal KNN performance
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation to find optimal k value
- **Model Evaluation:** Comprehensive evaluation using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
- **Visualization:** Performance plots showing cross-validation scores across different k values

## Requirements

```python
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sonar-classification-knn.git
cd sonar-classification-knn
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

3. Ensure your dataset is in the correct path:
```
2- Dataset/sonar.all-data.csv
```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to:

1. Load and explore the sonar dataset
2. Preprocess the data (scaling and train-test split)
3. Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
4. Train the final model with optimal parameters
5. Evaluate model performance

## Results

The model achieves optimal performance with hyperparameter tuning:
- **Best k value:** Determined through 5-fold cross-validation
- **Test set split:** 90% training, 10% testing
- **Preprocessing:** StandardScaler normalization
- **Evaluation metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Model Performance

The project includes detailed performance analysis:
- Classification report with precision, recall, and F1-scores
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Cross-validation score plots across different k values
- Error rate calculation

## Key Insights

1. **Feature Scaling:** StandardScaler is crucial for KNN performance due to distance-based calculations
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** GridSearchCV helps find the optimal k value (1-30 range tested)
3. **Cross-Validation:** 5-fold CV ensures robust model selection
4. **Binary Classification:** Effective distinction between rock and metal sonar signatures

## Future Improvements

- Explore other distance metrics (Manhattan, Minkowski)
- Try different preprocessing techniques (PCA, feature selection)
- Compare with other algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks)
- Implement feature importance analysis
- Add data augmentation techniques
